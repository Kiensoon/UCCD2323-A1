            <h3>1. CAPPADOCIA, TURKEY</h3>
            <p>Cappadocia is a living example of just how odd yet beautiful nature can be. It presents a fantasy-like landscape that looks like it's been plucked out of a fairy tale, with alien-like hills and boulders that seem as if they've been transported from another planet. The humans who once lived here used the area's soft stone to create underground shelters, leaving all kinds of weird architectural wonders in their wake. The lunar landscape is stunning on its own, but the countless hot-air balloons that fill up the sky with shades of red, yellow, orange and cream simply take its beauty to the next level. The Goreme Open Air Museum and its rock-cut churches and the subterranean wonders of Kaymakli are among the best things to see in Cappadocia.</p>

            <h3>2. WHITEHAVEN BEACH, WHITSUNDAYS, AUSTRALIA</h3>
            <p>It's easy to see why Whitehaven Beach ranks among the most photographed beaches in the world and is considered to be one of the best places to visit in the world. The magnificent 7 km stretch of white sand that feels like your own private slice of heaven presents an aura of peace and serenity, letting you experience relaxation at its very best. The beach is accessible via boat from Hamilton Island and the ports of Shute Harbour and Airlie Beach. To enjoy the best view of Whitehaven Beach, make your way to Tongue Point. Time your trip with a low tide and you'll get to see a mesmerizing fusion of colors that always promises the grandest of views. </p>

The waters are freezing, but if you're searching for wild swimming adventures, it truly doesn't get better than this. And if you're not as adventurous, a mere walk around the area, exploring aqua-blue pools, each more appealing than the other, is sure to leave you in high spirits. The place also has its own infinity pool, bounded by a beautiful stone wall! </p>

            <h3>4. GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, USA</h3>
            <p>There's a reason more than 5 million people choose to visit the Grand Canyon each year. It's one of the most magical destinations on the planet and is considered by many travelers to be one of the best places to visit in the world. Irrespective of how much you read about the Grand Canyon, you're sure to end up being spellbound, for nothing prepares you for the magical sight that this wonder has to offer. Considered to rank among one of the top 7 wonders of the world, this fascinating piece of art feels strikingly familiar, yet entirely unique. Its sheer size leaves you speechless and visiting the canyon during sunrise or sunset leaves you mesmerized because the scenery on display is so serene, so beautiful, so pure. The canyon is divided into three rims, North, West and South, and all three offer incredibly unique experiences. The South Rim is the most visited feature of the Canyon for it hosts a majority of the region's infrastructure, Native American ruins, viewpoints and historic artifacts. However, if youâ€™re after adventure and solitude, the North Rim is where you need to be. </p>

            <h3>5. HUACACHINA, PERU</h3>
            <p>Psy lovers and artists will fall in love with Huacachina, a stunning desert oasis that leaves you mesmerized with its raw beauty and fantastical legends. Think of yourself sitting on a huge dune enjoying breathtaking sunset views as the landscape reveals vivid colors of red and yellow all around you. Right in front of you lies a dreamy oasis that looks like a still from one of those Arabian Nights movies, dotted with palm trees, and covered with rustic hotels that offer the very best of luxury. Huacachina might lose out to Machu Picchu and Nazca in terms of popularity, but it provides a picture-perfect setting for those searching for mystery, adventure, or romance. Spend the evening serenading your sweetheart by the lake, but don't forget to keep an eye out for the mermaid that is said to live there.</p>
